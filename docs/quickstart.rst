Quickstart
==========

This guide should serve to get you up and running with a simple setup.

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need: 

#. Somewhere to run Ansible (if you have the ability, I suggest a virtual machine so you can just ssh in and manage it from anywhere).
#. At least one computer to be used as a signage player.

    * I recommend Ubuntu Server as the operating system on the player. That is the only Linux distribution I've tested. Theoretically, anything based on .deb and systemd should work, but I haven't tried it.

----------------------------
Preparing the signage player
----------------------------
This is fairly standard Ansible setup.
